I just completed a full Power BI dashboard project focused on BMW car sales between 2019 and 2023!
 This project showcases the entire data-to-dashboard journey, from data preparation to dynamic visualizations and insightful KPIs.
🔧 What I did:
- Cleaned and transformed raw sales data (Power Query)
- Added custom columns (Year, Month, Category…)

- Designed an interactive dashboard with filters, slicers & SVG sparklines
🚀 Key Takeaways:
 ✔ Data modeling matters for performance
 ✔ Storytelling is key to insight delivery
 ✔ DAX makes metrics powerful
 ✔ Design = usability + clarity
